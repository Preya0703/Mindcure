My Role & Contributions:
This project was developed as a team effort with clearly defined ownership. I was responsible for end-to-end frontend development and integration.

Specifically, I was responsible for:

Designing the complete UI/UX and application flow

Developing the full frontend using React.js and React Router

Building all major user-facing pages, including:

Login and Sign Up

Therapy Program pages (Sleep, Stress, Anxiety, Addiction)

Self-assessment question pages (Depression, Anxiety, Stress)

Welcome, Join Us, and Emergency support pages

Integrating frontend components with Python-based backend logic

Handling testing, debugging, and UI refinements to ensure smooth user experience

Preparing technical documentation and final project reports

Project Structure (High Level):
/src/pages – Core application pages and user flows

/src/components – Reusable UI components

/src/styles – SCSS styling and layout

/src/router – Application routing logic

Architecture & Flow:
Single Page Application built with React and React Router

Component-driven architecture for reusable UI elements

Page-level components manage user flows for therapy programs and assessments

Frontend designed to integrate with Python-based backend services via API endpoints

Outcome:
MindCure was successfully delivered as a responsive, user-centric mental health platform. The application enables users to explore therapy programs, complete self-assessments, and receive appropriate guidance through a clear and accessible interface.

The project demonstrates frontend ownership, real-world workflow design, and integration readiness for backend-driven mental health logic.

Notes

This project was developed in an academic setting, but with an emphasis on real-world usability, modular design, and clean engineering practices. Backend services are structured to be Flask-ready for future expansion.
