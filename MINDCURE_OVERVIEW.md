My Role & Contributions:

This project was developed as a group project, with individual responsibilities clearly defined. My contributions focused on end-to-end frontend ownership and system integration.

Specifically, I was responsible for:
Designing the complete UI/UX and application flow
Developing the full frontend using React.js and React Router
Building all major user-facing pages, including:
  Login and Sign Up
  Therapy Program pages (Sleep, Stress, Anxiety, Addiction)
  Self-assessment question pages (Depression, Anxiety, Stress)
  Welcome, Join Us, and Emergency support pages

Integrating frontend components with Python-based backend logic
Handling testing, debugging, and UI refinements to ensure smooth user experience
Preparing technical documentation and final project reports

Project Structure (High Level):
/src/pages – Core application pages and user flows
/src/components – Reusable UI components
/src/styles – SCSS styling and layout
/src/router – Application routing logic

Outcome
MindCure was successfully delivered as a responsive, user-centric mental health platform. The application enables users to explore therapy programs, complete self-assessments, and receive appropriate guidance through a clear and accessible interface.
The project demonstrates frontend ownership, real-world workflow design, and integration readiness for backend-driven mental health logic.

Notes
This project was developed in an academic setting, but with an emphasis on real-world usability, modular design, and clean engineering practices. Backend services are structured to be Flask-ready for future expansion.
